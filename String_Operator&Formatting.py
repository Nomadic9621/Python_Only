                            #Concatinate
#It Means Unifying(Adding) Two or More String into a Single String.
#By Using The + Operator, Like When We Add Two Numbers.

#Let's Try
x = "Cisco"
y = "Router"

# print(x + y) #Output = CiscoRouter
# #Like We Add in a Single Line


#String Repetation
#By Using Multiplication
# print(x * 3) #Output = CiscoCiscoCisco

#Not Operator 
#We Can Also Verify if a Character is in a String or Not.
#Let's Check

print("s" in x) #Output = True
print("v" in x) #Output = False

#But If We use b not in x, This Will Result in True Because We Negate----
#---The Existence of letter b in "Cisco".
print("b" not in x)
